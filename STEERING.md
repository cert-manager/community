# Steering Committee Charter

The goal of the cert-manager Steering Committee is to ensure that cert-manager
meets the needs of its current and future users. The Steering Committee
represents the voice of the user, and works with the cert-manager maintainers to
help guide development efforts towards solving concrete and immediate problems
for cert-manager adopters.

The members of the Steering Committee are:

- Florian Liebhart ([@FlorianLiebhart](https://github.com/FlorianLiebhart)) ([Volkswagen](https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en))
- Spyros Synodinos ([@ssyno](https://github.com/ssyno)) ([Giantswarm](https://www.giantswarm.io/))
- Ian Arsenault ([@ianarsenault](https://github.com/ianarsenault)) ([Snowplow](https://snowplow.io/))
- Trilok Geer ([@TrilokGeer](https://github.com/TrilokGeer)) ([Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en))

## Steering Committee Responsibilities

The Steering Committee’s responsibilities are to:

1. Provide feedback to project maintainers about cert-manager's featureset, UX,
   and operational model.
2. Assist cert-manager maintainers in prioritizing upcoming roadmap items and
   planned work.
3. Represent the "voice of the cert-manager user" both internally and to the
   broader community.
4. Provide neutral mediation for non-technical disputes.
5. Develop and maintain a project continuity plan.
6. Sit on the "Code of Conduct Committee" in the event that a violation of the
   Code of Conduct is reported

## Steering Committee Membership

The Steering Committee comprises at most 7 people. To be eligible for membership
in the Steering Committee, you must:

1. Be responsible for a production cert-manager deployment of non-trivial size
2. Be willing and able to attend regularly-scheduled Steering Committee meetings
3. Abide by cert-manager's Code of Conduct.

Candidates for membership will be nominated by current Steering Committee
members or by cert-manager maintainers. To be accepted as a candidate, a
person must have at least two nominators from this group.

If there are fewer proposed candidates than there are open seats, then the proposed
candidates may assume their seats immediately.

If there are more nominations than there are open seats remaining, existing
Steering Committee members may vote for candidates using the
[single transferable vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote)
system wherein candidates are ranked in order.

In the event of a tie, the tie shall be broken by a simple vote among cert-manager maintainers.
If the vote among maintainers is tied, then the tie shall be broken by random chance using a method
to be determined fair by all participants.

Membership expires if any of the eligibility conditions are unmet, or after one
year. Members may seek reinstatement immediately in accordance with the rules
above.

## Steering Committee Meetings

Steering Committee meetings will happen at least once per quarter but can be more frequent if needed.

All recordings and minutes will be posted publicly.

It is the responsibility of maintainers to ensure that meetings are scheduled and run, and maintainers are generally expected to attend these meetings to provide input and to listen.

Summary of discussion:

- Discussed a new 4-monthly release schedule for cert-manager. This was approved, although we also discussed how we can better enable users to consume alpha releases, including discussions on naming and frequency of prereleases.
- Mostly focused on the roadmap. We agreed several areas we'd like to focus on, and several areas which are listed in the current roadmap and which we think shouldn't be called out there.
- We agreed to collaborate on a roadmap asynchronously via a GitHub PR.

## Changes to This Charter

Changes to this document must be approved by a majority of Steering Committee
members and a majority of cert-manager maintainers, except for the list of
steering committee members that may be changed under the conditions listed under
"Steering Committee Membership".
